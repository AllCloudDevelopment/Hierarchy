# Hierarchy
Interactive visualization of your hierarchical data
If you are looking for an easy way to visually represent your hierarchical Salesforce data, look no further!, here is a lightning component for you. Using this component you can create highly interactive visual representation of your hierarchies.

This lightning component bundle has two components. One, a base component called 'Hierarchy' and the other a pre-built Org Hierarchy component that internally uses the first Hierarchy Component.

The OrgHierarchy component can be used for displaying your organizational hierarchy based on the manager ID associated with your Salesforce 'Standard' users. This component can be directly configured in the Lightning app builder.

The base Hierarchy component can be used for displaying any hierarchical data like Org Hierarchy, Account Hierarchy etc. This component supports interactive navigation of the data represented in the hierarchy. This component can be used by your developers to build their own lighting apps. Hierarchy data can be supplied either through an Apex class or a JSON String.

After installing this component, please refer to the detailed documentation in the <your salesforce instance>.lightning.force.com/auradocs/reference.app for more information about these components.
